Uttam is an Android app which gently updates your wallpaper with a perfectly crafted image everyday!

## Story

[The Story](https://www.ratik.in/writing/uttam)

## Development

If you want to clone this repo and compile the project, you can use the following steps:

1. Clone the project.
2. Add your Unsplash API Client ID to the `local.properties` file:

```
client_id=<UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID>
```

3. That's it!

## Postmortem

A lot of has happened since I initially wrote this app. Unsplash has made using their API a bit annoying so scaling this project did not make sense in my eyes. That said, I still adore the app and use it everyday! I will probably keep using this project as a learning ground to experiment and pick up new skills!

## Huge Thanks

Thanks a ton to [Arun](http://http://twitter.com/voidmaindev) and [Chetan](https://twitter.com/chetsachdeva) for helping me countless number of times while I was taking this codebase from it's legacy state to what it is now I learned so much in the process! Cheers!
